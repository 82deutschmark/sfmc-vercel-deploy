  "description": "Guardian, critical update from Space Command! The primary launch vector for Operation Silent Sentry has been compromised by solar flare activity. We need an immediate recalibration. The launch grid, a 3x3 matrix representing targeting coordinates, must be rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This ensures the payload avoids the radiation surge and reaches its designated orbit. Your precision is paramount â€“ the success of this multi-billion dollar asset and national security depends on your swift and accurate adjustment. Execute the rotation and confirm the new grid configuration.",
