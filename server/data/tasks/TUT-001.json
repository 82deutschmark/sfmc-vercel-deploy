  "description": "Before we start any missions, let's understand what you're looking at. Every grid is made up of squares. Each square is filled with a symbol - there are no empty spaces! The black square â¬› represents the number 0, and it's not 'empty' - it's just as important as any other symbol. Think of it like a chessboard where every square has something on it, even if it looks blank.",

    "This is your first look at a grid! See how the black square â¬› (which represents 0) and the green checkmark âœ… (which represents 1) work together? Every square has a value from 0 to 9.",
    "For this tutorial, just click on any square to see how the symbols change. You can cycle through all 10 different symbols by clicking repeatedly.",
    "The goal is simple: make your grid match the example. Since this one is already correct, you just need to click the green Submit button!"
