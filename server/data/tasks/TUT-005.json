  "description": "This is where human pattern recognition really shines! You can look at a partially filled grid and instantly see what's missing. Computers struggle because they don't understand the 'big picture' - they analyze each square separately instead of seeing the overall pattern. This ability to recognize and complete patterns is a fundamental part of human intelligence that's incredibly difficult for AI to replicate.",

    "Look for the pattern that's trying to emerge! In the first example, you can see checkmarks âœ… in the corners. The pattern wants to be symmetrical, so it needs a checkmark in the center too.",
    "Humans are amazing at seeing patterns that aren't complete yet. You can look at just a few pieces and imagine what the whole picture should look like. Computers can't do this naturally.",
    "In the test grid, look at where the checkmarks âœ… are placed. Can you see the cross or plus-sign pattern that wants to form? Fill in the missing pieces to complete it!"
