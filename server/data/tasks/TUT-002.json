  "description": "Now let's make your first change to a grid! This is the foundation of all puzzle-solving. You'll learn to click on squares to change their symbols. Remember, every symbol represents a number from 0-9, and we use space-themed symbols instead of colors to make it easier for everyone to see the differences clearly.",

    "Look at the example above. The input has all black squares â¬› (which means all 0s). The output has one green checkmark âœ… in the top-left corner (which means changing that 0 to a 1).",
    "Click on the top-left square of your grid. Each click cycles through the symbols. Click once to change the black square â¬› to a green checkmark âœ….",
    "Perfect! Now you understand the basic interaction. This skill - changing individual squares - is how you'll solve every puzzle in the game."
