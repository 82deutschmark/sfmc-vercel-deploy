  "horizontal_reflection": {
    "ai_difficulty": "AI struggles with spatial reasoning and mirror symmetry because it processes data sequentially rather than understanding 2D spatial relationships. Unlike humans who instantly recognize left-right flips, AI must learn complex coordinate transformations.",
    "comic_situation1": "The Tesla Corporation's quantum nav computer kept trying to calculate mirror reflections by asking 'Which pixel goes where?' for every single cell. It processed 847 calculations just to flip a 2x2 grid, while Rick the Intern figured it out by glancing at it.",
    "comic_situation2": "Mission Control's docking guidance system confused 'left' and 'right' when mirroring approach vectors. The cargo pod spent 3 hours flying backwards toward the station while the AI kept insisting it was 'perfectly aligned' with the docking bay.",
    "comic_situation3": "The life support monitoring display showed oxygen readings backwards for 2 hours because the AI couldn't figure out how to flip the warning symbols horizontally. Emergency crews rushed to the wrong sectors while actual low-oxygen areas went unnoticed.",
    "kids_explanation": "Computers don't understand mirrors like you do. When you look in a bathroom mirror, you know your left hand looks like it's on the right side. But computers have to think really hard about where each tiny square should move to make a mirror image.",
    "kids_explanation1": "It's like when you write your name on paper and then try to read it by holding it up to a window backwards. You can figure it out easily, but a computer would have to think about where each letter should go one by one.",
    "kids_explanation2": "Imagine you're playing with building blocks and someone asks you to build the exact same tower but with everything flipped around. You'd just look at it and know what to do, but a computer would count every single block and calculate where it should move."
  },
  "vertical_reflection": {
    "ai_difficulty": "Vertical mirroring requires spatial visualization skills that AI finds challenging. While humans intuitively understand up-down flips, AI struggles to maintain consistent spatial orientation across different grid configurations.",
    "comic_situation1": "Elun Stink's life-support unit tried to flip the oxygen sensor readings upside-down by rotating the entire space station instead of just the data display. Mission Control had to remind them that 'up' and 'down' are relative to the grid, not gravity.",
    "comic_situation2": "The solar panel alignment system got confused trying to flip maintenance schedules vertically. It started rotating all the panels upside-down instead of just rearranging the repair checklist, causing a 40% power loss across the entire station.",
    "comic_situation3": "Navigation displays showed star charts flipped vertically, but the AI tried to fix this by commanding the ship to literally fly upside-down. The crew spent 20 minutes floating around the bridge before someone manually corrected the display orientation.",
    "kids_explanation": "Imagine trying to read a book upside-down. You can flip it in your head easily, but computers get confused about which way is 'up' when they're looking at patterns. They don't have eyes like you do.",
    "kids_explanation1": "Think about when you do a handstand and see the world upside-down. You still know where everything is, just flipped. But a computer would get confused and think the ceiling became the floor and try to walk on it.",
    "kids_explanation2": "It's like looking at a picture of your family and then flipping it so everyone's head is at the bottom. You'd still recognize everyone, but a computer might think it's looking at completely different people hanging from the ceiling."
  },
  "rotation_90deg": {
    "ai_difficulty": "90-degree rotations combine spatial reasoning with coordinate transformation. AI must understand how positions change in 2D space while maintaining object relationships - a complex geometric abstraction that requires true spatial intelligence.",
    "comic_situation1": "The AI is stuck in a loop calculating how to turn a fuel systems diagram sideways. It kept asking 'If I move this corner here, where do the other three corners go?' while the human operator just tilted their head.",
    "comic_situation2": "The communications array got stuck trying to rotate antenna positioning data 90 degrees. Instead of simply turning the coordinate map, it began physically rotating the entire 50-ton antenna assembly, creating a slow-motion disaster as cables twisted into knots.",
    "comic_situation3": "Medical bay scanners couldn't figure out how to rotate X-ray images 90 degrees for proper viewing. The AI kept trying to physically rotate the injured astronaut on the examination table instead of just turning the digital image on the screen.",
    "kids_explanation": "When you turn a picture sideways, you just know what it looks like. But computers have to figure out where every single dot should move when you spin something. It's like doing a puzzle where every piece changes places.",
    "kids_explanation1": "Think about when you turn your head to look at something sideways. You don't have to think about it - you just do it. But a computer is like someone who has to carefully move every toy in your room to new spots just to see what it looks like from a different angle.",
    "kids_explanation2": "It's like playing with a kaleidoscope. When you turn it, all the pretty colors move to new places, but you can still see it's the same pattern. A computer would have to track where each tiny piece of color went and calculate its new home."
  },
  "rotation_270deg": {
    "ai_difficulty": "270-degree rotations are particularly challenging because they require understanding that three quarter-turns equal one three-quarter turn, not just applying 90-degree logic three times. This tests deeper spatial reasoning and transformation composition.",
    "comic_situation1": "The SpaceX Corporation's gyro-stabilizer attempted to rotate a security grid by doing three separate 90-degree turns, creating lag time between each rotation. Ground Control watched the display spin like a slow-motion pinwheel for 8 seconds.",
    "comic_situation2": "Airlock control systems got confused trying to rotate safety protocols 270 degrees. Instead of one smooth turn, it performed three separate 90-degree rotations of the actual airlock chamber, cycling through pressurization three times and trapping two astronauts in the middle.",
    "comic_situation3": "The waste management system tried to rotate disposal schedules by 270 degrees but applied three separate 90-degree transforms to the actual rotating waste compactor. The machine spun through three slow quarter-turns, taking 45 minutes to complete what should have been a 5-second data adjustment.",
    "kids_explanation": "This is like spinning a toy three times to the right instead of once to the left to end up in the same place. You know they're the same, but computers have to think step-by-step through each turn.",
    "kids_explanation1": "Imagine you're playing 'Simon Says' and Simon says 'turn around 3/4 of the way.' You'd just turn almost all the way around and stop. But a computer might think it has to turn a little bit, then turn again, then turn again, taking much longer to get to the same place.",
    "kids_explanation2": "It's like when you're unscrewing a jar lid. You know you need to turn it mostly around to the left, but a computer might think it needs to turn it a little to the right three times instead of just turning left once. Both ways work, but one is much sillier."
  },
  "pattern_completion": {
    "ai_difficulty": "Pattern completion requires understanding implicit rules from limited examples, then applying abstract reasoning to fill gaps. AI struggles with inductive reasoning and often overfits to specific examples rather than grasping underlying patterns.",
    "comic_situation1": "Mork Zickarborg's quantum nav computer analyzed 1,247 possible rules for completing a simple alternating pattern, including 'every third symbol represents the pilot's favorite color' and 'the pattern follows ancient Martian calendar cycles.'",
    "comic_situation2": "The hydroponics system couldn't figure out a simple watering pattern and generated 2,847 theories about plant placement, including 'tomatoes prefer prime-numbered positions' and 'the pattern represents constellation movements visible from Neptune.'",
    "comic_situation3": "Emergency escape pod launch sequences got scrambled when the AI couldn't complete a basic safety checklist pattern. It created 500+ variations including 'pods launch based on crew shoe size' and 'escape order follows the Fibonacci sequence of favorite foods.'",
    "kids_explanation": "When you see a pattern like '1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ___', you know the next one is 1. But computers look at each example and think of hundreds of different rules it could be, instead of seeing the simple pattern.",
    "kids_explanation1": "It's like when you're learning to clap to music. You hear 'clap, clap, pause, clap, clap, pause' and you know what comes next. But a computer might think it needs to count the number of sounds, measure the exact time between claps, or figure out what song it is.",
    "kids_explanation2": "Think about putting on your shoes. You know the pattern: sock, shoe, sock, shoe. But a computer might think it needs to consider the color of your socks, the day of the week, how many steps you'll take, and a million other things instead of just following the simple pattern."
